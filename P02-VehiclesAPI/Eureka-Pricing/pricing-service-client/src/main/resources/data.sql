/*
I ran the prices field (and the associated randomPrice function) in the Pricing Service file in Replit and copied the
output into these insert statements. Since the prices are random anyways I figured copying the first output would suffice
as hypothetical data. I'm curious if there is a way to automate this. Nineteen individual insert statements is rather
laborious so I can imagine thousands has to be automated.
